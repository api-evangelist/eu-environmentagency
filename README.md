# EU EnvironmentAgencyThis is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [EU EnvironmentAgency APIs](http://www.eea.europa.eu/code/gis). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [EU EnvironmentAgency APIs](http://www.eea.europa.eu/code/gis).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](http://www.eea.europa.eu/code/gis)- [Developer](http://www.eea.europa.eu/code/gis)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/euenvironment)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/eu-environmentagency/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the EU EnvironmentAgency APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
